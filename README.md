# ✅ VerifyBot
VerifyBot was created to overhaul member verification for my Discord server known as Original People. New server members could fill out a Google form to apply for verification, and server admins would use the bot to either approve or deny applications. Upon being approved, new members receive a nickname and the roles they requested in the form.

**Including:** UptimeRobot to ping the server for 99% uptime

## Features
- **Google Workspace Apps Integration:** New server members complete a Google form to provide their information for verification and request roles, which is logged into a Google sheet.
- **Grant Server Access:** The bot will nickname new users and give them roles that grants them access to the rest of the server.
- **Message Embeds:** The bot will organize info from applications into an embed that is shown to server admins.
- **Reaction Input:** Server admins can approve or reject a verification application using emoji reactions.
